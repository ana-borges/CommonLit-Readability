## CommonLit-Readability
Kaggle competition for rating the complexity of literary passages for grades 3-12 classroom use.

This repository contains a fundamental approach for participating in the [CommonLit Readablility Price competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize).

* The folder `scripts` are found python scripts to automatize the preprocessing of the text, as well as to add useful text measurements to the relevant dataframes.
  * The subfolder `tests` contains some of the trials which have been not deleted, but not final either.
  * The subfolder `bert` contains the first steps into implementing the [BERT](http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) model using two different libraries: keras and ktrain.
* The folder `notebooks` contains notebooks explaining the data analysis carried so far.
* The folder `data` contains all the relevant data provided by the competition.
  * The subfolder `outputs` contains the outputs generated by the scripts, used in the notebooks.
